# How to get appointment information using non-visual control


<p>Problem:</p><p>How can I display information about selected appointments on a new page? I'd like to pass the appointment ID and then retrieve the necessary information not showing the scheduler to the end-user on the client side. The problem is with the elements of the recurrence chain - they are not present in the database.</p><p>Solution:</p><p>You can obtain appointment info directly from a database. Although you cannot bypass the ASPxScheduler, a non-visual control suffices to operate scheduler objects and API. </p><p>The input appointment ID is an integer, which may be followed by an underscore and a number, signifying that this is an appointment occurrence whose occurrence index equals to that number.</p><p>The example implements the AppointmentSearchHelper class to perform a search by iterating through appointments contained within a storage. When necessary, a pattern is expanded to calculate the appointment occurrences chain.</p><p>Performance tips:<br />
1)  Navigation buttons visibility. Recalculation of target appointments takes too much time. Make buttons invisible to speed up the loop.<br />
2) Reduce the number of appointments in the storage. To accomplish this, modify the query used by a data source to retrieve data.</p>
